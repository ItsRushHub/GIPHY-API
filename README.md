# GIPHY-API

This was a assigment where we had to use the Giphy API that populates gifs in HTML. You click on a button and it brings up 10 gif images and displays them on the page. You can also create your own button and that to then list of buttons. When you click on a certain gif image it plays and when you click again it stops playing.

Technologies:
HTML
CSS
Bootstrap
Javascript
JQuery
